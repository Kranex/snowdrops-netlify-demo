          The first snowdrops are already peeping through but sadly, thanks to
          coronovirus, the Snowdrop Festival as we usually know it won't happen
          this year. We aren't letting that deter us though. We're still
          determined to celebrate the lovely snowdrop, and we hope you'll join
          in too. Our theme for this year - 'Hope in Nature' - couldn't be more
          relevant. Being in the fresh air amongst nature and plants is known to
          be healing.


          ### ***So, children, families, adults, businesses - get involved!***


          ​Let's all work together to brighten our town with real and hand-made snowdrops. Over the years we've planted tens of thousands. Help us add to them!  For this year, let the snowdrop be our sign of hope and recovery as we look to the spring and a happier and healthier 2021. Make a snowdrop, pen a poem or write a story, and play your part in enhancing our Shepton Mallet Snowdrop Trail.
