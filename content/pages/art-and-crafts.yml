          but we're still keen to support these eight artists and craft makers
          from Somerset who showed with us in 2020. With fairs, festivals and
          shows cancelled, the last year has been tough for artists and makers
          everywhere. They'd love to hear from you. Please be sure to visit
          their websites/on-line shops to view their work, and buy! "

          ​In 2014 Chris exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS)
          Hampton Court Flower Show for the first time and the RHS Rosemoor
          Garden winter sculpture show, at which he is now a regular. The
          introduction of stainless steel sculptures with its reflective
          qualities has added another dimension to his work. Much of Chris’
          inspiration is from nature, the humble hedgerow has given him most
          opportunity to expand on his theme. Cow Parsleys, teasels, grasses,
          wild roses and ferns make up the majority of his designs. Most
          recently, a few flowers have been introduced; mini rudbeckia has
          proved to be popular and larger versions have followed. Inspired by
          the display at East Lambrook Manor Gardens, snowdrops have also been a
          big hit. Now you can have snowdrops in your garden all year round.

          Clare produces beautiful tiles, hand decorated with wax resist, paper
          stencil and limited edition screen print.  Her pebbles and touch
          stones are constructed from press moulded porcelain and individually
          decorated with inlay, impressions and screen print. They are frost
          proof and can be displayed in outside spaces.


          You can see Clare's love of nature and natural shapes in everything she creates. Delicate hand-cut porcelain leaves are added, piece by piece,  to create a lace-like translucent shape.


          'I work with surface; breaking up 2D space, abstracting natural forms and fauna to produce images that strive to capture a twisted tendril or fragile leaf. The pieces are wall mounted ceramic sculptures, or tiles for architectural or interior settings. The techniques of printmaking are used to illustrate the designs, creating a feeling of layers and elements collaged together'.
