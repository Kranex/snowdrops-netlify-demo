          # We asked you to show your ‘Hope in Nature’ for a brighter, healthier
          2021 by celebrating the Snowdrop. You created your own, both real and
          handmade arts and crafts, you penned a poem or wrote a story.


          The early green shoots and delicate flowers of the snowdrop signal the start of a new year, the promise of spring, and fresh hope for healthier times ahead. The healing power of nature, plants, trees and gardens is well known. For many people they're a lifeline during these times of Lockdown, helping them to cope with loneliness and giving them a sense of wellbeing.
